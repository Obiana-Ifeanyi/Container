The steps involved in the Docker architecture are:

    The developer creates a Docker image by defining the application code, dependencies, and configurations in a Dockerfile.

    The Docker client sends the build command to the Docker daemon, which then builds the Docker image.

    The Docker image is stored in the Docker registry, where it can be shared with others.

    The developer creates a Docker container by running the Docker image with the Docker run command.

    The Docker container runs on a Docker host, which can be a physical or virtual machine.

    The Docker container can communicate with other Docker containers on the same Docker network.

Overall, the Docker architecture simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and managing applications by using containerization technology.
